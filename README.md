# AI Tools Directory

## 1. Dataset Used
I used an **AI Tools Catalog dataset**.  
The dataset includes:
- Tool name  
- Logo  
- Description  
- Pricing (free / paid / freemium)  
- Features  
- Votes  
- Category

## 2. How I Generated the Dataset
I did not scrape any external website.  
I generated the dataset using **ChatGPT**.

### Process:
I asked ChatGPT to generate a list of AI tools in **JSON format** with fields like:
- name  
- logo  
- description  
- pricing  
- free / paid / unpaid  
- features  
- votes  

ChatGPT returned clean JSON data, and I used that dataset directly in the project.

## 3. Tech Stack
The required tech stack was already mentioned in the assignment PDF, and I followed that as instructed.

For UI/UX design inspiration, I visited:
- Similar AI tools directory websites  
- Dribbble  
- Awwwards

## 4. AI Prompt Examples Used
Here are some examples of prompts I used:

1. **"Give me 50 AI tools in JSON format with fields: name, logo, description, pricing, features, votes, category."**  
2. **"Generate more tools with the same JSON structure. Keep formatting clean."**  
3. **"Return only the JSON without explanation."**

## 5. Improvements If Given 2 More Days
If I had two extra days to work on this project, I would add:

- More categories and filters  
- Pagination  
- Better animations  
- Uploading real custom logos for each tool  
- A **Compare Tools** feature
